      .tab-content

          %h2 Install for RSpec
          %h4 Include the gem in your Gemfile:
          %pre.code-sample
            %code.language-ruby
              :preserve
                group :test do
                  gem 'shoulda-matchers', require: false
                end
          %h4 Then require the gem following rspec-rails in your rails_helper (or spec_helper if you're using RSpec 2.x):
          %pre.code-sample
            %code.language-ruby
              :preserve
                require 'rspec/rails'
                require 'shoulda/matchers'

    %li.tab-header-and-content
      %a.tab-link(href="#")
        Test::Unit
      .tab-content
        .installation-instructions
          %h2 Install for Test::Unit
          %h4 shoulda-matchers was originally a component of Shoulda -- it's what provides the nice should syntax which is demonstrated below. For this reason, include it in your Gemfile instead:
          %pre.code-sample
            %code.language-ruby
              :preserve
                group :test do
                  gem 'shoulda'
                end

    %li.tab-header-and-content
      %a.tab-link(href="#")
        Non-Rails Apps
      .tab-content
        .installation-instructions
          %h2 Install for Non-Rails Apps
          %h4
            Once it is loaded, shoulda-matchers automatically includes itself
            into your test framework. It will mix in the appropriate matchers for
            ActiveRecord, ActiveModel, and ActionController depending on the
            modules that are available at runtime. For instance, in order to use
            the ActiveRecord matchers, ActiveRecord must be available beforehand.
          %br
          %h4
            If your application is on Rails, everything should "just work", as
            shoulda-matchers will most likely be declared after Rails in your
            Gemfile. If your application is on another framework such as Sinatra
            or Padrino, you may have a different setup, so you will want to ensure
            that you are requiring shoulda-matchers after the components of Rails
            you are using. For instance, if you wanted to use and test against
            ActiveModel, you'd say:

          %pre.code-sample
            %code.language-ruby
              :preserve
                gem 'activemodel'
                gem 'shoulda-matchers'
          %h4 And not
          %pre.code-sample
            %code.language-ruby
              :preserve
                gem 'shoulda-matchers'
                gem 'activemodel'
